# WP SecurityCommunity

Welcome to an unofficial WP Security Community.

We hope to build a home for WordPress security evangelists to share the latest information on best practises and discuss how to help users improve security by education and grass root evangelising. 

## Why?

The reason why we want this is to have a centralised location where we can discuss what are the latest knowledge we should be sharing, and have peer support check our suggestions and presentations.

We would love to be part of the wordpress.org project team list, but since we understand that would take time and consideration from the community we have created this as a stop gap. 

## What are we doing?
We're sharing solutions to hardening WordPress further than the current wordpress.org documentation, resources and useful links in this repo. You'll also find a collection of links to great external resources. We know that many companies have internal documentation to security best practises and welcome them to share their resources either via a link or by adding it to the Wiki.  

To start with, Combell's Brecht is sharing their guide "Securing your WordPress site

## What are we *not* doing?

We are **not** the WordPress sercurity team. We not the people to share security issues with. 

If you wish to report a sercurity issue, please see the latest information at [security.wordpress.org](http://security.wordpress.org).

## Duplication of Effort

Please if you know of any community of peple doing the same thing let us know. We would like to have one location of communication and are aware that it is possible that is already been discussed on the internet in another location.

We are happy to not duplicate efforts and join a greater WordPress security evagelist group.

## Why Github?

This is the most transparent way of communicating that we know. Many of us already use Github and thought this would be a quick, low-effort, stress-free location.  

## The future
In the future, we envision this to break out further and help with more low hanging security issues in the project and ensure that future secuirty evangelising has the most up to date information as possible.
