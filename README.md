# WP-Security-Community

##Welcome to an unoffical WP Security Community.

We hope to build a home for WordPress security evangelists to share the latest information on best practises and discuss how to help users improve security by education and grass root evangelising. 

## Why?

The reason why we want this is to have a centralised location where we can discuss what are the latest knowledge we should be sharing, and have peer support check our suggestions and presentations.

We would love to be part of the wordpress.org project team list, but since we understand that would take time and consideration from the community we have created this as a stop gap. 

## What are we doing?
We're documenting security issues, best practices and useful links in this repo. You'll also find a collection of links to great external resources. We know that many companies have internal documentation to security best practises and welcome them to share their resources either via a link or by adding it to the Wiki.  

To start with, Combell's Brecht is sharing their guide "Securing your WordPress site"


## The future
In the future, we envision this to break out further and help with more low hanging security issues in the project and ensure that future secuirty evangelising has the most up to date information as possible.
